Data:
- Besides add URLs from other sources, try to use oversampling techniques to deal with the imbalance problem


Features:
- Use more techniques for sellecting Features to extract
- After extract, dig deeper on the EDA of features and datasets
- EXTREMELY focus on EDA process


Model:
- Use one or more models rather than just Logistic Regression for comparison in accuracy and performance


Evaluation:
- Test on datasets that different from train and test set
