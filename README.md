# <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting phishing URLs. The model uses [sklearn] to classify URLs as either legitimate or phishing.

# <a name="usage"></a> Usage
Explain how users can use your model to detect phishing URLs. Provide clear instructions, including any command-line interfaces or API endpoints that users can interact with. If applicable, include code snippets or examples to demonstrate the usage.

```python3
import phishing_url_detector

model = phishing_url_detector.PhishingURLDetector()
result = model.detect_url('http://example.com')

print(result)
```

# <a name="datasets"> Datasets
If you used a specific dataset to train your model, provide information about the dataset here. Include details such as the data sources, size, format, and any preprocessing steps applied to the data.

# <a name="model-training"> Model Training
If you trained the model yourself, explain the training process, including the steps and techniques used. Provide any relevant details about the feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.

# <a name="evaluation"> Evaluation
Describe how you evaluated the performance of your model. Include information about the evaluation metrics used, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Also, discuss any limitations or challenges you encountered during the evaluation process.

# <a name="contributing"> Contributing
If you welcome contributions from the community, outline the guidelines and instructions for contributors. Include information about how to report issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests.

# <a name="license"> License
