## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction
This repository contains a machine-learning model for detecting phishing URLs. The model uses [sklearn] to classify URLs as either legitimate or phishing.

## <a name="datasets"> Datasets
This project requires a large number of authentic (0) and phishing (1) URLs.

The open-source tool PhishTank makes it relatively simple to collect phishing URLs. This site offers a collection of phishing URLs that are updated hourly in a variety of formats, including CSV, JSON, etc. Visit https://www.phishtank.com/developer_info.php to download the information.

n order to find the legitimate URLs, I discovered a source that has a collection of benign, spam, phishing, malware, and defacement URLs. University of New Brunswick, https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/url-2016.html, is the dataset's original publisher. 35,300 valid URLs are included in this collection. The URL collection is downloaded, and the file of importance is "Benign_list_big_final.csv" from that.
